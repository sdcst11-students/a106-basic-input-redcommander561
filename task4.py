# Surface area of a cone
# Find the surface area of a cone given the height and the radius.
# You will need to ask the user to enter in both variables, and will 
# need to use the Pythagorean relationship to find the slant height.

# Inputs:
# height, radius

# Outputs:
# surface area

# Test output
# r = 3
# h = 5
# sa = 83.2297607912
height = int(input("height: "))
radius = int(input("radius: "))

print("Surface area is", 3.14 * radius(radius + height**2 + radius**2)**0.5 )
